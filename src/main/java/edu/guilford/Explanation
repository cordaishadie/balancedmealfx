I feel as though I don't have a fully complete development trail in mt Github repository.
This is because throughout this course, I haven't gootten used to the practice of pushing my code to Github after every change.
I worked on my code locally, for a long time, and then pushed it to Github.
However, I did add a few commits to my repository, and it contains the most major changes to my code.
Additionally, I did add comments to my code, and I did use the JavaDoc tool to generate documentation for my code,
so that my code is more readable and understandable.
